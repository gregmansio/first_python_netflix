# first_python_netflix
Investigation Netflix movies and guest stars in The Office

This is my first ever project using Python. It is part of Datacamp Professional Certificate: Data Scientist with Python 

The purpose of the project is to quickly analyze movie duration with regards to year of release.
It appears that more recent movies aren't shorter if we filter for documentaries or child movies. 
Further inspection would be required to properly test that hypothesis.
